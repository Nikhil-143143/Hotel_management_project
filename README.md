# Hotel_management_project
The Hotel Management System is to streamline the 
booking process, manage customer data, handle room availability, and 
facilitate billing in a user-friendly manner. The system aims to enhance 
operational efficiency, improve customer experience, and provide a 
comprehensive management solution for hotel staff. 


Technology Stack Overview 

♦ Programming Language:
Java: The code is written in Java, leveraging its object-oriented capabilities for 
creating a hotel management system.
Html and css for design and creating web page.


Core Concepts: 

♦ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): 
Classes and Objects: Utilizes classes (Hotel, Double room, Single room, Food, 
and holder) to encapsulate data and functionality. 
Encapsulation: Information about customers and room types is encapsulated 
within specific classes. 

♦ Data Structures: 
Arrays: Utilizes arrays to manage room availability (luxury_doublerrom, 
deluxe_doublerrom, etc.). 

♦ Control Structures: 
Switch Statements: Used for decision-making based on user input (room types, 
booking logic). 
Loops: For iterating over room availability and managing menu interactions. 

♦ Error Handling: 
Try-Catch Blocks: Implements basic exception handling to manage input errors 
and null references.

♦ Input/Output: 
Scanner: Utilizes the Scanner class for user input. 
System.out: Standard output for user interaction and displaying information. 

♦ Design Patterns: 
Factory Pattern (implied): Potential for room creation through methods that 
abstract room booking details. 

♦ Extensibility: 
The code structure allows for easy addition of new room types and features, 
enhancing maintainability.
